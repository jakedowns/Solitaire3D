Windows LeiaDevice Add-on

Description:
    Contains device support for Windows builds.

Requisite:
    Windows builds are available to business partners of Leia Inc.
    Requires Leia Inc. Windows firmware platform 1.1.0.3 or above.
    Check C:\Program Files\LeiaInc\LeiaDisplaySdk to verify that your firmware is installed.
    Check that your external monitor is connected by USB.

Quick start:
    Build to Windows on x86 or x86_64 with this SDK.
    Run an app built with the Leia Inc. Unity SDK.

Troubleshooting:
    1. Is there a folder C:\Program Files\LeiaInc\ on your machine? Is there a file C:\Program Files\LeiaInc\LeiaService\Logs\ServiceLog_<currentDate>.txt?
        If not, contact Leia Inc. for Windows firmware.

    2. Open Add or Remove Programs and search for "Leia" programs; confirm that LeiaService is installed on your machine and that it is described as 1.1.0.3+.
        If not, contact Leia Inc. for the Windows firmware installer / "bootstrapper" and install instructions.

    3. Disconnect your Leia Inc. display's back microUSB port, reconnect it, then wait 20 seconds.

    4. For the following questions, refer to the last lines of the log file at
        C:\Program Files\LeiaInc\LeiaService\Logs\ServiceLog_<currentDate>.txt

    5. Does the log file report that a USB device was recently connected?
        If not, check the USB wire and ports of the PC and display.

    6. Does the log file report that the recently connected USB device is a Leia device?
        If not, check the USB wire and ports of the PC and display.

    7. Run C:\Program Files\LeiaInc\LeiaDisplaySdk\TestConsoleCpp.exe. Did the .exe run without generating any errors?
        If not, please report the errors in the log file to Leia Inc. and continue to next steps to see if the issue appears in Unity builds also.

    8. Build a Unity scene with a LeiaCamera + LeiaDisplay in the scene from LeiaLoft internal SDK version 0.6.14+.
        To check the LeiaLoft SDK version, please report all the lines of Assets/LeiaLoft/Resources/VERSION.txt

    9. Is LeiaDisplayService.Wcf.dll in the same directory as the .exe which you wish to run?
        If not, please move LeiaDisplayService.Wcf.dll so that it is in the same directory as your .exe

    10. Did the .exe run with the backlight on?
        If not,
            - please share the LeiaService log file with Leia Inc.
            - please share the Unity .executable's log file with Leia Inc. - see https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LogFiles.html

    11. Did the .exe draw the pixels in generally the correct position onscreen?
        If not,
            - please share a screenshot with Leia Inc.
            - please share the LeiaService log file with Leia Inc.
            - please share the Unity .executable's log file with Leia Inc. - see https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LogFiles.html

    12. Did the .exe draw the pixels in generally correct sections of the screen, but do the pixels not produce an image with depth?
        Try using the LeiaConfigSettingsUI (Assets/LeiaLoft/Modules/Internal/LeiaConfigSettingsUI/Prefabs) to change the slant of the display.
        If that did not resolve the issue,
            - please share a screenshot with Leia Inc.
            - please share the LeiaService log file with Leia Inc.
            - please share the Unity .executable's log file with Leia Inc. - see https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LogFiles.html
