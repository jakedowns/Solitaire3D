INTERNAL-ONLY RELEASE NOTES
=============

OVERVIEW
========

This file tracks info that is confidential, experimental, and/or intended only for 8-view users.

KNOWN ISSUES and GENERAL WARNINGS
=================================

2020-08-19
    If building to Windows from Unity 2017.1.5 with graphics API DirectX 12 (Experimental) and a prefab like the LeiaConfigSettingsUI prefab is in a scene,
        scene will crash. Workaround is to change graphics API to DirectX 9.

2020-04-02
    Windows only - LeiaService versions before 1.1.0.3 return wrong slant values for some 8-view displays.
        Workaround for now is to use LeiaConfigSettingsUI to change slant at runtime to suit your display.

WHAT'S NEW
==========

2022_01_03
    Resolved an issue where ACT vector x coordinates were unsigned because ViewSharpening was expected to be symmetric, but ViewSharpening shader implementation was not necessarily symmetric. 

0.6.21.1

2021_12_17
    Implemented X-and-or-Y-offset ACT in ViewSharpening shader. C# sets sharpening pixels being drawn from vertical steps up or down, then left or right, of central pixel.
    Updated LeiaConfigSettingsUI ("CTRL-L menu") to use SliderInputAction for all Sliders, instead of working with a mix of Sliders and SliderInputActions.

0.6.21
    Resolve an issue which appeared after 0.6.20 release and before 0.6.21 release, where subpixel interlacing would only sample 1 view (subpixel interlacing should sample 3 views per onscreen pixel).

0.6.19

2021_05_11
    We now support 32-bit Unity Windows applications.

2021_04_26
    Users may still build 64-bit Unity Windows applications.
    Now use WindowsLeiaDevice / LeiaDisplayParams.DLL to retrieve interlacing matrix from displays.
    LeiaService 1.2 now returns the optically ideal 12.5 ViewResolution value of 1680 x 945 (increased from 1280 x 720). Review FPS with this 72% increase in pixel
        rendering in mind.
    Be sure to use Add/Remove Programs to delete LeiaService 1.1.0.x if it is also installed on your machine.
    Be sure to restart your machine after installing LeiaService 1.2.
    On the 12.3 display class, SerialPortUtility must report this information or better:

0.6.21
2021_12_06
    Removed calls in WindowsLeiaDevice to LeiaService :: LeiaDisplayParamsWrapper :: getViewResolution due to failure of call on 12V 2160p displays. Added workaround code to Leia Unity SDK.

0.6.18

2021_04_15
    Enabled the LeiaConfigAdjustments / Ctrl-L menu to automatically display ACT X or ACT Y depending upon display orientation.
    Resolved a bug with the LeiaConfigAdjustments / Ctrl-L menu where Slanted Android devices might not have an ACTXY[2] or ACTXY[3].
    Modified the ACT load process in a way that is incompatible with previous use.
        Previously 8-view displays would use "ACTY" params in landscape orientation.
        However, users must now tune "ACTX" params (default on 8-view displays is [0,0,0,0]) in order to see changes in landscape.
        The CTRL-L menu will allow you to tune these params in your editor project or build.
        Renaming the file "/Assets/Resources/DisplayConfigUpdateSlanted12pxActX.json" to DisplayConfigUpdateSlanted.json will also populate ACTX with the default 8v ACT params.

2021_04_09
    Resolved several bugs with ViewSharpening in subpixel automotive displays and on rotatable devices.

2021_02_26
    Resolved an issue which affected odd-view slanted/subpixel displays where some views would not sample RGB correctly.

2021_02_24
    Implemented an AbstractArtifactWrapper for retrieving data from external libraries in a consistent way.
    Added dependency on LeiaDisplayParams.dll

2021_02_16
    Moved interlacingMatrix override calculation from SlantedLeiaStateTemplate to WindowsLeiaDevice. On Android slanted/subpixel devices, we will simply retrieve the
        interlacingMatrix from firmware.

2021_02_11
    Added infrastructure for supporting up to 16 views in interlacing shader. This required sampling from a tiled sub-texture.

0.6.17

2021_02_04
    Added support for alpha blending / interlaced material transparency in slanted shader. Resolved a non-square-matrix (4x3) issue in .cginc file. Allows OpenGL ES 1.2.

2021_01_06
    Removed calls from WindowsLeiaDevice / DLLCommunicationLayer to LeiaDisplaySdkCpp.dll as these were introducing a crash on the 12.3 displays.

0.6.16 or earlier

2020_10_23
    Included 12.3" display in LeiaDisplay device emulation list

2020_07_20
    Added support for SetBacklightTransition to WindowsLeiaDevice.

2020_02_24
    Added automatic backlight control and DisplayConfiguration loading to Windows Leia applications

2020_02_13
    Consolidated LeiaViewSharpening and SlantedViewSharpening into one shader with two compiler variants.
